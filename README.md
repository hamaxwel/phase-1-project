Version Control:

## Setup/Installation Instruction
Download a zip in the code button to the desired folder
Extract the files
Open the extracted folder with VSCode
Go live or open the index.html file with chrome
And you are all done.

## Usage
Add new crops, livestock, or resources using the forms provided.
View details, edit, or delete entries directly from the lists.
Use the search bar to filter through existing records.
Manage your farm's operations with ease and keep track of all relevant data in one place.

## Known Bugs
Deleting a resource or livestock entry may not immediately reflect on the list due to caching issues. Refreshing the page resolves the issue.
In some cases, the input validation messages may not display correctly when adding or updating entries.
Editing an entry might not always close the modal after submission; manually closing it is required.

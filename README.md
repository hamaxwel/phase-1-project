## Known Bugs
Deleting a resource or livestock entry may not immediately reflect on the list due to caching issues. Refreshing the page resolves the issue.
In some cases, the input validation messages may not display correctly when adding or updating entries.
Editing an entry might not always close the modal after submission; manually closing it is required.
